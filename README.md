Hi, Iâ€™m Nickolas, 28 year old, ~~living in Copenhagen~~ travelling South America.

Former Senior Frontend Engineer gone remote freelancer (Feel free to contact me with any work)

I have worked with frontend dev at large Danish tech companies for 6 years.

In my spare time I have also done my fair share of Rust dev (in private repos sorry)

I also have a great interest in AI competitions, mostly on https://www.codingame.com/

Hit me up and let's work together!
